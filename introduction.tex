\chapter{Introduction}
Quantum computing is an exciting and rapidly evolving field of a modern science. One of the popular implementations of a quantum computer is based on an ability to control and measure systems of trapped ions.
\section{Why do we need resonators?}
\label{sec:why_resonators}
RF traps require quite high voltage. In order to sustain low temperatures need for an adequate functioning of an ion trap cables used inside of a cryostat must have low heat conductivity. Such materials also have low electrical conductivity, which inevitably leads to generation of a more thermal power than a cooling system can potentially dissipate while preserving ~4K temperature. Thus a solution would be to use an amplifier (resonator) close to the high voltage target.
\section{Context of a project}
\label{sec:context}
Microfabricated ion traps provide a scalable realization for quantum computations, potentially reusing existing electronics machinery and allowing for a mass fabrication.
\section{Kinds of resonators}
\label{sec:kinds_resonators}
There are multiple types of resonators typically used. This includes helical and RLC resonators.
