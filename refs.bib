abstract = {Ions confined using a Paul trap require a stable, high voltage and low noise radio frequency (RF) potential. We present a guide for the design and construction of a helical coil resonator for a desired frequency that maximises the quality factor for a set of experimental constraints. We provide an in-depth analysis of the system formed from a shielded helical coil and an ion trap by treating the system as a lumped element model. This allows us to predict the resonant frequency and quality factor in terms of the physical parameters of the resonator and the properties of the ion trap. We also compare theoretical predictions with experimental data for different resonators, and predict the voltage applied to the ion trap as a function of the Q-factor, input power and the properties of the resonant circuit.},

abstract = {We propose a planar architecture for scalable quantum information processing (QIP) that includes X-junctions through which particles can move without micromotion. This is achieved by adjusting radio frequency (rf) amplitudes to move an rf null along the legs of the junction. We provide a proof-of-principle by transporting dust particles in three dimensions via adjustable rf potentials in a 3D trap. For the proposed planar architecture, we use regularization techniques to obtain amplitude settings that guarantee smooth transport through the X-junction.},

abstract = {High voltage radio frequency (RF) supply is a critical part in an ion trapping system. The RF supply should have high Q-factor and relatively high driving frequency. A frequently used RF supply for an ion trap system is a helical resonator. In certain applications, it is advantageous to have a predictable resonant frequency and Q-factor when the helical resonator is connected to a capacitive load. We develop a model to describe the behavior of a helical resonator with capacitive load. With this model, we can correctly predict the loaded resonant frequency and the loaded Q-factor. To test our prediction, we construct a helical resonator, and measure its resonant frequencies and Q-factors under different capacitive loads. The experimental results agree with our prediction.

abstract = {Emerging and re-emerging tick-borne diseases threaten public health and the wellbeing of domestic animals and wildlife globally. The adoption of an evolutionary ecology framework aimed to diminish the impact of tick-borne diseases needs to be part of strategies to protect human and animal populations. We present a review of current knowledge on the adaptation of ticks to their environment, and the impact that global change could have on their geographic distribution in North America. Environmental pressures will affect tick population genetics by selecting genotypes able to withstand new and changing environments and by altering the connectivity and isolation of several tick populations. Research in these areas is particularly lacking in the southern US and most of Mexico with knowledge gaps on the ecology of these diseases, including a void in the identity of reservoir hosts for several tick-borne pathogens. Additionally, the way in which anthropogenic changes to landscapes may influence tick-borne disease ecology remains to be fully understood. Enhanced knowledge in these areas is needed in order to implement effective and sustainable integrated tick management strategies. We propose to refocus ecology studies with emphasis on metacommunity-based approaches to enable a holistic perspective addressing whole pathogen and host assemblages. Network analyses could be used to develop mechanistic models involving multi host-pathogen communities. An increase in our understanding of the ecology of tick-borne diseases across their geographic distribution will aid in the design of effective area-wide tick control strategies aimed to diminish the burden of pathogens transmitted by ticks.},

abstract = {The use of coaxial or reentrant resonators is practical at frequencies down through the high-frequency band and even lower. By introducing a helical inner conductor, a Q of several thousand can be achieved in relatively small volume. Design equations are simple and are the basis for an alignment chart. The unloaded Q is equal to 50 times shield diameter in inches times square root of resonance frequency in megacycles. Shield length is about 30 per cent greater than its diameter. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the predicted Q. The method is also applicable to min-iaturized UHF resonators, and to the design of high-Q radio-frequency inductors and LC resonators. Additional formulas and a chart relate frequency, Q, volume, voltage gradient and power rating. LIST OF SYMBOLS b=axial length of coil, inches. B = inside length of shield, inches.

abstract = {We have investigated motional heating of laser-cooled 9Be+ ions held in radio-frequency (Paul) traps. We have measured heating rates in a variety of traps with different geometries, electrode materials, and characteristic sizes. The results show that heating is due to electric-field noise from the trap electrodes which exerts a stochastic fluctuating force on the ion. The scaling of the heating rate with trap size is much stronger than that expected from a spatially uniform noise source on the electrodes (such as Johnson noise from external circuits), indicating that a microscopic uncorrelated noise source on the electrodes (such as fluctuating patch-potential fields) is a more likely candidate for the source of heating.},
